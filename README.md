The goal of import-json is to demonstrate import of a JSON file.

## Prerequisites

- This repo comes with the `Todos Registros.json` file that will be imported.
  You do not need to download data yourself.
- Make sure you have opened the project by double-clicking the `import-json.Rproj` file.

## Code

Run `import.R` to:

- load the data
- analyze the internal structure and extract a flat data frame
- compute counts by group
- display an exploratory plot
- save the data as an Excel file
